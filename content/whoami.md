Hello!

My name is **Hyungwon Kim** aka **hwkim301**, and I'm currently a student.


I currently live in Seoul, Korea. I'm {{< calculate_age >}} years old. 


I'm a self taught programmer(?), not sure if I can call my self a programmer but anyways ... 


I'm interested in Python and *nix. 


I enjoy playing with computers, reading books and eating food.


I'll try to post the technical struggles and trivial life here.
