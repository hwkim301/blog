The URL for level1 changed from `274877906944.html` to map.html.


As I said previously it's good practice to check the HTML title first.


The HTML title for level1 is *What about making trans?* 


I'm also given a scratch book.


{{< figure src="/img/pythonchallenge/level1/map.jpg" alt="map" >}}


It's a notebook that has `K->M, O->Q, E->G` written on it.


If you look carefully shifting *2 alphabets* from K gets you M, O gets you Q, E gets you G. 


```
K,L,M 
O,P,Q 
E,F,G 
```


There's also a ciphertext.

Shifting `2` characters from our ciphertext `g fmnc wms bgblr rpylqjyrc gr zw fylb. rfyrq ufyr amknsrcpq ypc dmp. bmgle gr gl zw fylb gq glcddgagclr ylb rfyr'q ufw rfgq rcvr gq qm jmle. sqgle qrpgle.kyicrpylq() gq pcamkkclbcb. lmu ynnjw ml rfc spj.` will likely gives us the decipher.


[Caesar_cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is similar to the level1.


The only difference between Caesar cipher and level1 is that Caesar Cipher shifts `3` letters instead of `2`. 


[ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is another famous substitution cipher. 


ROT13 shifts 13 lettters as it says in the name. 


The `dec` function gets each character's ASCII value and subtracts the ASCII value of character `a` to get the index of the alphabet and adds `2`. 


This gives us the offset(how far it is away from the character `a`) and takes the remainder of it divided by `26`. 


You need to divide it by `26` because there are `26` letters in the alphabets. 


`97` is the ASCII value for `'a'` so by adding the offset with `97` gives you the actual letter.


I initially wrote the `dec` function like this.


```python
def dec(cipher):
    decrypt = ""
    for c in cipher:
        if c in letters:
            decrypt += chr((ord(c) - ord("a") + 2) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            decrypt += c
    return decrypt
```


Many people said string concatenation is generally bad practice in Python. 


Especially if the string is long. 


Reading [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39675898/is-python-string-concatenation-bad-practice) will give a detailed explanation.


According to the post string concatenation is fine if the string is short, but using `''.join()` is the better choice so I went with that. 


```python
import string 
letters = string.ascii_lowercase


def dec(cipher):
    decrypt = []
    for c in cipher:
        if c in letters:
            decrypt.append(chr((ord(c) - ord("a") + 2) % 26 + 97))
        else:
            decrypt.append(c)
    return "".join(decrypt)

# print(dec("map")) => ocr
```


Here's the decipher below.


`i hope you didnt translate it by hand. thats what computers are for. doing it in by hand is inefficient and that's why this text is so long. using string.maketrans() is recommended. now apply on the url`


The decipher tells me to use `string.maketrans()` but because I've never used `string.maketrans()` I decided not to. 


Since the URL for level1 is http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/map.html I should do the `2` letter shift on the word **map**. 


Passing `map` to the `dec` function gives you `ocr`.


Changing the URL from [map](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/map.html) to [ocr](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/ocr.html) gets you to level2.  




P.S 


You can also do the same process with shellscript. 


```bash
echo "g fmnc wms bgblr rpylqjyrc gr zw fylb. rfyrq ufyr amknsrcpq ypc dmp. bmgle gr gl zw fylb gq glcddgagclr ylb rfyr'q ufw rfgq rcvr gq qm jmle. sqgle qrpgle.kyicrpylq() gq pcamkkclbcb. lmu ynnjw ml rfc spj." | tr a-z c-za-x
```


If the letter is between `a-x` you can `2` letter shift it to `c-z`, but if the letter is `y` or `z` it needs to go back to `a` or `b` so the letters are changed from all the letters except `y`,`z` which is `a-z`.


That's the reason why you need the extra `a-x` after `c-z`.
